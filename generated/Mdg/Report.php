 * This is the top-level message used by the new traces ingress. This

 * eventually be documented as a public ingress API. This message consists
 * solely of traces; the equivalent of the StatsReport is automatically
 * generated server-side from this message. Agent should either send a trace or include it in the stats
 * for every request in this report. Generally, buffering up until a large
 * size has been reached (say, 4MB) or 5-10 seconds has passed is appropriate.
 * This message used to be know as FullTracesReport, but got renamed since it isn't just for traces anymore
